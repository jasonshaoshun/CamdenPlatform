# Image Recognition

This folder contains an image classifier to determine human body postures fromo live video footage.

## References

As a feature extraction technique we use a [TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation) of the [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) library. We plan to modify this implementation to automatically
create data that will be then labeled in order to be classified.
